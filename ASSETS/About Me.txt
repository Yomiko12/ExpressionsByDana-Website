About Me:

I am a mom of two wonderful kids, and I know first hand how quickly our children grow and change!  I want to help you capture those adorable memories to hold onto for a lifetime.  Each stage of a child’s life is one to be treasured.  Memories fade, but photos will keep those moments alive every time you see them.
	A woman’s glow during pregnancy, when her ever changing body is no 			longer just her own;  
	From those tiny toes, to glowing eyes, a newborn has a sweetness like no 		other;  
	Those first smiles and toothless grins of a chubby little baby will melt your 		heart; 
	The playfulness of a toddler, curiosity of a child, the know-all of a 				teenager; 
Wherever your kids are in life, let’s remember them just the way they are today! 



My Sessions:
I have been a photographer for over 10 years, serving the Winnipeg and surrounding area.  I have a home studio where I love creating beautiful sets, and I also love exploring our local surroundings to find unique backgrounds for my sessions. 

My  studio offers a variety of options - from maternity, newborn, baby and family.  I adore fun loving families that want timeless images to display in their homes.  My sessions are casual, light hearted and playful. 

I love being creative with my sessions and adding elements into my shoots to help create a story.  I also love COLOUR! I want my images to stand out and be noticed in the natural way that our eyes see colour around us.  

I will work with you to plan and deliver a great experience and images that you are sure to treasure.  I recognize that each family is unique and I want your family dynamic and personality to shine through.
